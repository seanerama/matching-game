## Questions to Explore

### About the Game Design
- How many card pairs do you want? 30 pairs to start, since I have 3 kids, this will give each 5 professions
- Should each child appear in multiple professions, or should professions be split among them? professions should be split among them
- Do you want a mix of "matching pairs" (same image) or "related pairs" (e.g., firefighter + fire truck)? same image. 

### About the Professions
- What mythical/fantasy roles excite them? dragon rider, wizard, mermaid, fairy, knight, druid, sorceress, queen, unicorn tamer, gryphon rider, witch, troll hunter, pirate ship captin, tavern keeper 

### About the Photos
- Do you have clear, front-facing photos of each child that would work well with AI editing? Yes
- Should the background change with the profession (e.g., space for astronaut, castle for knight)?Yes
- Do you want consistent poses across all cards, or variety? consistent

### About the Format
- **Physical cards**: Printed on cardstock, laminated for durability?
- **Digital game**: An app or interactive PDF? APP! 
- **Hybrid**: Both a printed version and a digital backup? 

### About the Audience
- Who will play this game? (The kids themselves, grandparents, classroom?)
- Is this for personal use, or could it be a gift for others (grandparents, relatives)?

## Action Plan

### Phase 1: Preparation (1–2 days)
1. **Select source photos** — Choose 1–2 high-quality, front-facing photos of each child
2. **Create profession list** — Pick 10–15 professions (mix of real and mythical)
3. **Decide on card count** — Recommended: 12–16 pairs (24–32 cards total)

### Phase 2: AI Photo Editing (2–4 days)
1. **Choose an AI tool** — Options include:
   - [Fotor AI Clothes Changer](https://www.fotor.com/features/ai-change-clothes/) — Free, user-friendly
   - [LightX AI Costume Generator](https://www.lightxeditor.com/photo-editing/ai-virtual-outfit-try-on/) — Great for uniforms & costumes
   - [Photoleap AI Costume Generator](https://www.photoleapapp.com/features/ai-costume-generator) — Mobile-friendly
   - [Pincel AI](https://blog.pincel.app/photo-clothes-ai/) — Detailed prompt control
2. **Generate images** — Create 2 copies of each profession image (for matching pairs)
3. **Review & refine** — Touch up any awkward AI results; ensure consistency

### Phase 3: Card Design (1–2 days)
1. **Choose card size** — Standard is 2"×2" or 2.5"×2.5" squares
2. **Design layout** — Add profession name below each image (optional)
3. **Create uniform card backs** — Use a fun pattern or family logo

### Phase 4: Production (1–3 days)
1. **Print on cardstock** — Use 110 lb cardstock for durability
2. **Laminate** (optional) — Extends lifespan significantly
3. **Cut cards** — Use a paper cutter for clean edges
4. **Package** — Store in a small box, drawstring bag, or tin

## Implementation Suggestions

### AI Tool Tips
- **Prompt specificity matters**: "Child wearing a doctor's white coat with stethoscope in a hospital" works better than just "doctor"
- **Batch similar professions**: Do all "uniform" professions together (doctor, chef, pilot) for consistency
- **Save originals**: Keep unedited photos in case you need to re-generate

## Potential Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| AI produces unrealistic results | Use multiple AI tools; adjust prompts; choose simpler poses |
| Kids' faces don't blend well | Use front-facing, well-lit photos; avoid complex backgrounds |
| Too many profession ideas | Start with 12 pairs; create expansion packs later |
| Cards wear out quickly | Laminate or use card sleeves |

## Next Steps

- [ ] Gather 2–3 clear photos of each child
- [ ] Draft a list of 15 profession ideas (ask the kids for input!)
- [ ] Test one AI tool with a single photo to evaluate quality
- [ ] Decide on physical vs. digital format
- [ ] Set a target completion date (birthday? holiday?)
